      <b>Permissions</b>
      <p>
        To submit API requests from a remote system, you need a valid API user account on the appliance where you will run the Web Services API. Create one of the following API user accounts:
        <ul>
          <li>
            api_analyst
          </li>
          <li>
            api_monitor
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The following tables show the breakdown of the user access and what actions they can perform.
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Permissions</td>
